# Description:  Demonstration of using the len() function with strings

# Create a list of items
# groceryList = []
groceryList = ["eggs", "milk", "bread", "squash", "cheese"]

# Use the len() function to count how many items
#   are in the list.  Store the integer result to
#   the numItems variable
numItems = len(groceryList)

# Display the number of items in the console
print(numItems)
